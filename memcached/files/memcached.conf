# memcached default config file
# 2003 - Jay Bonci <jaybonci@debian.org>
# This configuration file is read by the start-memcached script provided as part of the Debian GNU/Linux distribution. 

# Run memcached as a daemon. This command is implied, and is not needed for the
# daemon to run. See the README.Debian that comes with this package for more information.
-d

# Log memcached's output to /var/log/memcached
logfile /var/log/memcached.log

# Be verbose
# -v

# Be even more verbose (print client commands as well)
# -vv

# Start with a cap of 64 megs of memory. It's reasonable, and the daemon default
# Note that the daemon will grow to this size, but does not start out holding this much memory
-m {{ server.cache_size }}

# Default connection port is 11211
-p {{ server.bind.port }}

-U {{ server.bind.port }}
# Run the daemon as root. The start-memcached will default to running as root if no
# -u command is present in this config file
-u memcache

# Specify which IP address to listen on. The default is to listen on all IP addresses
# This parameter is one of the only security measures that memcached has, so make sure
# it's listening on a firewalled interface.

# Return error when memory is exhausted (rather than removing items)
# -M

# Maximize core file limit
# -r

# Number of threads to use to process incoming requests.
-t {{ server.threads }}

# Set size of each slab page. Default value for this parameter is 1m, minimum is 1k, max is 128m.
